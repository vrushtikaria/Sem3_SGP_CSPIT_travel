            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nubra, also called Dumra, is a historical region of Ladakh,[1] that is currently
            administered as a
            subdivision and a tehsil in the Leh district. Its inhabited areas form a tri-armed valley cut by the Nubra
            and Shyok rivers. Its Tibetan name Dumra means a "valley of flowers".[2] Demands have been raised and BJP
            has hinted at creation of Nubra as a new district. Diskit, the headquarters of Nubra, is 120 km north from
            Leh, the capital of Ladakh
        </p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shyok River meets the Nubra River (or Siachan River) to form a large valley that
        separates the Ladakh and
        Karakoram Ranges. The Shyok river is a tributary of the Indus river. The average altitude of the valley is more
        than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above the sea level. The common way to access this valley is to travel over the
        Khardung La pass from Leh. <br>

    <div>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tirthan valley is the main gateway to the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP).
            Actually, without the national park, the secluded valley would have probably remained unknown. </p> <br>
    </div>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the valley comes from the Tirthan River that flows from Tirth, its origins
        located in the GHNP, and ends at Larji in the Beas river.
    </p> <br>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tirthan valley has plenty of hidden gems and so, it will allow you to enjoy various
        activities such as relaxation, day hikes, multi day treks or trout angling.
    </p> <br>
    <p>Best time to visit Tirthan valley is March, April, May, June, and then October, November and December.
    </p>
    <p>
        Avoid the monsoon between July and August as it rains a lot and the paths become slippery and there are chances
        of landslides.

    <div>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phuktal Monastery or Phuktal Gompa (often transliterated as Phugtal) is a Buddhist
            monastery located in the remote Lungnak Valley in south-eastern Zanskar, in the Himalayan region of Ladakh,
            in Northern India. It is one of the only Buddhist monasteries in Ladakh that can still be reached only by
            foot. Supplies to the monastery are brought on horses, donkeys, and mules in the warmer months, and in the
            frozen winters, they are transported through the frozen Zanskar River. A road is expected to be built up to
            the monastery, however, for now, it is a day's walk from Village Cha or Village Khangsaar, the end of the
            road leading from Padum. The Phugtal monastery was Solar powered up in 2016[1] with a team of Global
            Himalayan Expedition (GHE) members. </p> <br>
    </div>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phuktal Monastery is built around a natural cave, which is believed to have been
        visited by numerous sages, scholars, translators, and monks around 2,550 years ago. The remote location of the
        monastery was ideal for monks looking for peace and solitude to meditate.
