            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Somnath temple, also called Somanātha temple or Deo Patan, is located in
            Prabhas Patan, Veraval in Gujarat, India. One of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for the Hindus, they
            believe it to be the first among the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. Reconstructed several times in the
            past after repeated destruction by several Muslim invaders and rulers, it is unclear when the first version
            of the Somnath temple was built. Estimates for the first Somnath temple vary between the early centuries of
            the 1st-millennium to about the 9th-century CE. The temple's history is a subject of disputes and remains
            controversial. </p> <br>
