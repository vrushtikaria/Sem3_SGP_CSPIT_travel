                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pattadakal, also called Paṭṭadakallu or Raktapura, is a complex of 7th and 8th
                century CE Hindu and Jain temples in northern Karnataka (India).
            </p>
            <br>
        </div>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattadakal was considered a holy place, being where the Malaprabha river turned
            northwards towards the Himalayas and the Kailasha mountain.
            As its name implies, it was used during the Chalukya dynasty for coronation ceremonies, such as that of
            Vinayaditya in the 7th century.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shettihalli Church (referred to as Sathalli in colonial documents) is located 2km
                from Shettihalli, Hassan, in Karnataka. Built in the 1860s by the French missionaries in India, the church
                is a magnificent structure of Gothic Architecture.\ After the construction of the Hemavati Dam and Reservoir
                in 1960 the church was abandoned.] It has since then become a famous tourist spot where people flock to see
                the half submerged church during monsoon. It is also known as The Submerged Church and The Floating Church.
            </p> <br>
        </div>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church was built in 1860 by the French missionaries for the wealthy British estate
            owners. In 1960 the construction of the Hemavati Dam and Reservoir led to the abandonment of the church. Since
            then the church submerges in water every year during monsoon season. It attracts a lot of tourists who visit the
            ruins to see this spectacular sight.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enjoy the surreal beauty of Shettihalli church,[4] one needs to travel to this place
            twice. Once in the month of July–October when it is partially submerged in water and next in the month of
            Dec–May when the water level recedes and the church grounds emerge.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Ranganatha, a form of
                the Supreme God, Maha Vishnu, located in Srirangam, Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India.[4] Constructed in the
                Dravidian architectural style, the temple is glorified by Alvars in their Divya Prabhanda[5] and has the
                unique distinction of being the foremost among the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to The Supreme God Vishnu.
            </p> <br>
        </div>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the most illustrious Vaishnava temples in South India rich in legend and history.
            The temple has played an important role in Vaishnavism history starting with the 11th-century career of Ramanuja
            and his predecessors Nathamuni and Yamunacharya in Srirangam. Its location, on an island between the Kollidam
            and Kaveri rivers,[4] has rendered it vulnerable to flooding as well as the rampaging of invading armies which
            repeatedly commandeered the site for military encampment.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple was looted and destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate armies in a broad plunder
            raid on various cities of the Pandyan kingdom in early 14th century. The temple was rebuilt in late 14th
            century,[8][9] the site fortified and expanded with many more Gopurams in the 16th and 17th centuries.[10][11]
            It was one of the hubs of early Bhakti movement with a devotional singing and dance tradition, but this
            tradition stopped during the 14th century and was revived in a limited way much later.
